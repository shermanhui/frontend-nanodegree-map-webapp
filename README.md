# frontend-nanodegree-map-webapp

## Personal Objectives

Tools:
- Use Knockout
- Implement Jasmine Testing
- Use HTML5 BoilerPlate
- Use Bower
- Use Grunt

Project Objectives:
- Locate Dive sites around Vancouver
	- Display/Find using GoogleMaps API
	- Search for Dive Sites/Scuba Diving APIs on the web
- Use Instagram API to upload relevant photos 

## How will I complete this Project?

- Review our course [JavaScript Design Patterns] (https://www.udacity.com/course/ud989-nd).
- Download the [Knockout framework] (http://knockoutjs.com/).
- Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the [Google Maps API] (https://developers.google.com/maps/).
- Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations you are interested in within this neighborhood.
- Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
- Implement a list view of the identified locations.
- Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our [Intro to AJAX course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud110-nd).

## Helpful Resources

None of these are required, but they may be helpful.
- [Foursquare API] (https://developer.foursquare.com/start)
- [MediaWikiAPI for Wikipedia] (http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API%3aMain_page)
- [Google Maps Street View Service] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/streetview)
- [Google Maps] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)

## Project Overview

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Why this Project?

The neighborhood tour application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

## What will I Learn?

You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

## How does this help my Career?

Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers
Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged
